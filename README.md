this is my version of the (mostly?  I think it's complete but maybe you'll find something missing) completed jQuery calculator in-class assignment we did on Friday, April 27th, 2018.

it seems to work properly:
- it accepts button inputs
- it accepts operator inputs
- it computes the answer
- it has checks to guard against improper inputs and alerts the user accordingly
